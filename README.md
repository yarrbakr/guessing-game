# guessing-game
This is my first project in python, a simple number guessing game that increase or decrease the points based on the guessed number.
1. It uses simple functions and if-else statements to match the numbers
2. Also has a points system that is not saved in a file (will work on it in future)
3. uses the random module functions to generate random integers between 1 and 10
